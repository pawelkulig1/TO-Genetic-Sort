# TO-Genetic-Sort

This project was developed as part of Numerical Methods course at AGH University Of Science And Technology, written in Matlab.

### Project Goal
Goal of this project was to develop Genetic Algorithm  (GA) that will sort array of integers. 
This solution is far from being perfect it has very low convergence and is for certain not usefull as sorting array algorithm
but may be usefull as base for more accurate problems.
